          <h2>Avoiding Scams</h2>
		  <h3>Deal locally, face-to-face —follow this one rule and avoid 99% of scam attempts.</h3>
          <p>Do not provide payment to anyone you have not met in person.<br>
Beware offers involving shipping - deal with locals you can meet in person.<br>
Never wire funds (e.g. Western Union) - anyone who asks you to is a scammer.<br>
Don't accept cashier/certified checks or money orders - banks cash fakes, then hold you responsible.<br>
Transactions are between users only, no third party provides a "guarantee".<br>
Never give out financial info (bank account, social security, paypal account, etc).<br>
Do not rent or purchase sight-unseen—that amazing "deal" may not exist.<br>
Refuse background/credit checks until you have met landlord/employer in person.<br>
"craigslist voicemails" - Any message asking you to access or check "craigslist voicemails" or "craigslist voice messages" is fraudulent - no such service exists.</p><br>
